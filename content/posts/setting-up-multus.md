title: "Setting up Multus for multi-interface pods"
date: 2021-08-25T16:47:00+10:00
draft: true
---

This is for the odd bunch of people who need to attach multiple interfaces to their Kubernetes pods. Why?

Coming from the telecommunications industry, there's a push to containerized some of the packet pushing functions on platforms such as Kubernetes to promote DevOps/NetOps practices (think infrastructure/configuration as code). Conventional networking setup for applications just wouldn't cut it for reasons such as:

- ability to connect to multiple networks (VLANs, VPNs etc...) so that containerized routing functions can route traffic between networks
- direct access to the hardware network interface, often achieved with macvlan and SR-IOV to ensure high throughput

Some challenges I've seen so far include:

- routers (especially in the core) are expected to be highly performant, therefore consumes a lot of resources and physical NICs, meaning entire racks of computes are often dedicated to them
- the nature of exchanging routing information using protocols like BGP means IP addresses are often statically assigned to the containerized routing functions, so don't expect to lift and shift the container into another subnet/availability zone using different subnet ranges without some configuration changes on the other side of the connection

But, I'm not here to talk about use cases. Today, I just want to say I can do it ðŸ™ƒ

## Setup

I'll be testing this out with a Kubernetes cluster created with Kubespray. The secret sauce here is the [Multus](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni) CNI which enables attaching multiple network interfaces to pods. On top of that, I'll be using macvlan to give the pods "direct" access to the Kubernetes nodes' network interfaces so that my pods look more like routers with real interfaces.

### Deploy Kubernetes cluster with Kubespray

For deploying the Kubernetes cluster, I just followed the [Quick Start](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray#quick-start) guide, replacing the IPS with the IP addresses of my VMs
```
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cp -rfp inventory/sample inventory/mycluster
declare -a IPS=(10.1.1.5 10.1.1.6 10.1.1.7)
CONFIG_FILE=inventory/mycluster/hosts.yaml python3 contrib/inventory_builder/inventory.py ${IPS[@]}
ansible-playbook -i inventory/mycluster/hosts.yaml  --become --become-user=root cluster.yml
```

### Install Multus

Once the cluster is up and running, I installed the Multus plugin following the Multus' [Installation](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md#installation) instructions:
```
git clone https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni.git && cd multus-cni
cat ./images/multus-daemonset.yml | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Defining Network Attachments

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: macvlan-internal
spec:
  config: '{
      "cniVersion": "0.3.0",
      "type": "macvlan",
      "master": "ens6",
      "mode": "bridge",
      "ipam": {
        "type": "host-local",
        "subnet": "10.1.10.0/24",
        "rangeStart": "10.1.10.200",
        "rangeEnd": "10.1.10.250",
        "gateway": "10.1.10.1"
      }
    }'
EOF

cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: macvlan-external
spec:
  config: '{
      "cniVersion": "0.3.0",
      "type": "macvlan",
      "master": "ens7",
      "mode": "bridge",
      "ipam": {
        "type": "host-local",
        "subnet": "10.1.20.0/24",
        "rangeStart": "10.1.20.200",
        "rangeEnd": "10.1.20.250",
        "gateway": "10.1.20.1"
      }
    }'
EOF
```

Create deployment
```
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

    app: busybox
  name: busybox

        command: ["tail"]
        args:
        - "-f"
        - "/dev/null"
EOF
```

## Where's my macvlan CNI plugin

```
ubuntu@ubuntu:~/multus-cni$ k describe pods

```

The message tells ms the macvlan plugin can't be found. Checking on the Kubernetes node tells the same story:
```
ubuntu@node1$ ls -la /opt/cni/bin/ | grep macvlan
ubuntu@node1$
```

I don't know why the macvlan plugin isn't provided by Kubespray, but that's an investigation for another time. For now, off I go to build the macvlan plugin from [source](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins/main/macvlan). The procedure is pretty simple:

1. Make sure I have `go` installed
1. Clone the [containernetworking/plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins) repository
1. `cd` into plugins/plugins/main/macvlan
1. Run `go build`
1. Copy the resulting macvlan binary into `/opt/cni/bin/` of all my Kubernetes nodes

Once the macvlan plugin is made available, the pod comes up fine
```
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ k get pods

That was fun.
